Try opening the Console in the Inspector and typing 'd3.' - you should see options appear, and you can experiment with D3 code directly there. Note that this works because D3 is loaded in the 'head' tags of this HTML page - if D3 is not loaded then nothing will appear when you type 'D3.' in the console")
